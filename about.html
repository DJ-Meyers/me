      <div class="description">
        <p>I'm a 22-year-old student currently attending the University of Florida where I spent my first two years studying Materials Science.  After my first two years of Materials Science, I realized that I didn't enjoy Chemistry as much as I thought I did, and frankly I wasn't great at it.  When considering my options for a major change, I thought about the only class I enjoyed in Materials Science - my FORTRAN programming class.  I decided to switch my major to Computer Science, because it combines my love of language, grammar, and structure with my passion for problem-solving and mathematics.  I'm currently completing my 4th year of university and my 2nd year of Computer Science.</p>
        <p>I'm passionate about science outreach and have spent the last two summers working as a counselor at the University of Florida's Student Science Training Program, where I've served as a mentor to 179 high school students.  I worked closely with a group of 13 students each year, advising them on their research and guiding them as they wrote a paper about their findings.  As someone who participated in the program in 2011, I wanted to give back to a program that helped me discover my passion for science.  I've always loved being a mentor, whether it was offering free tutoring during lunch in high school, or making an impact on students at UF's SSTP.  I hope to continue to grow as a mentor in the future as a project manager or technical lead.</p>
